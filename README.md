# Powershell Design Patterns
Design patterns implemented with PowerShell.

## Introduction

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

# How contribute?
## Contributing


To contribute follow the next steps:

1. Analyze design patterns available in [issues](https://github.com/marcelotm23/powershell-design-patterns/issues).
2. When you choose one create one issue here, using the template [New pattern](https://github.com/marcelotm23/powershell-design-patterns/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new-pattern&template=new-pattern.md&title=%5BNEW%5D+Category%3A+new+pattern+name).
3. Asign yourself.
4. Fork repository (<https://github.com/marcelotm23/powershell-design-patterns/fork>)
5. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b creational/singleton`)
6. The solution structure should be:
    * A folder inside of category folder with pattern name, follow the previous example: ```Creational/Singleton```

        * Inside of this folder should be:
            - Source code files: *.ps1
            - Readme .md file with a short explanation about pattern example and purpose.
            If includes design diagram, it will be awesome :smile:
7. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some Singleton'`)
8. Push to the branch (`git push origin creational/singleton`)
9. Add to _Authors_ section in Repository readme.
10. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/marcelotm23/powershell-design-patterns/compare).
